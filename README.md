# Grocery Management System

The **Grocery Management System** is a comprehensive **three-tier web application** designed to streamline the operations of an online grocery store.  
This application provides a complete platform for users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and simulate checkout, while also offering a robust backend for managing products and orders efficiently.

With a modern **frontend built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, the application delivers a responsive and user-friendly interface that works across devices. The **backend, powered by Python and Flask**, handles all business logic, routing, and API endpoints for smooth functionality. Data is securely stored and managed using **MySQL**, enabling persistent storage for products, user data, and transactions.

This project is ideal for learning **full-stack development** with Python, understanding **database integration**, and building real-world applications with **clean UI/UX design** and modular architecture.
